How to send 16 bits of data with the 8bits processor ?

MAYBE depending on the value of PORT_ID we have we send the MSB of LEDS or the LSB of LEDS

--> out_port    /  port_id
--------------------




Things I sould try  :

A) Replace output s0,00  with s0,01 => so i can see if we have a difference.                  //normally not i just switch tthe output port   so hopefully it will still work otherwise maybe i have to check how they conncect the route in vivado


B)



    2) then with 4 bits  (2^4    =>    16   so 2*8 bits  so   00 then 01)      COMAPRECY







    3) Using the Video of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KurFCcvw0qA&ab_channel=VahidMeghdadi
        Add the Afficheur7segments module
