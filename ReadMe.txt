TO DO
--------
update the .xdc file        //maybe they are no changelents to do
--------------------




Things I sould try  :

A) Replace output s0,00  with s0,01 => so i can see if we have a difference.                  //normally not i just switch tthe output port   so hopefully it will still work otherwise maybe i have to check how they conncect the route in vivado


B) 1)  Do the binary adder with 3 bits first     WE HAVE TO SWITCH PROG FOR PROG2   2 times
        Mater le COMPARE and TEST



    2) then with 4 bits  (2^4    =>    16   so 2*8 bits  so   00 then 01)      COMAPRECY







    3) Using the Video of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KurFCcvw0qA&ab_channel=VahidMeghdadi
        Add the Afficheur7segments module
